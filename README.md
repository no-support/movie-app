# Movie App

execute test finished on node v13.14.0
1. install node (didn't work at v18. if you use other node version, I recommend install nvm to choose from variant node versions which is in your local computer.)
2. in this local repo directory, type `npm install` on shell so that node_modules folder could be created.
3. after install finished, type `npm start` to execute app.
